# Growth Log — montereybayevents.com

> **What this file is for:** an honest, append-only log of growth experiments
> on this site — what was tried, what was measured, what happened. The data
> source is GSC; this file narrates *why*. Future-you (or future-Claude)
> reads this when deciding what to try next, both on this site and on
> related sister sites.

## How to use this (workflow — re-read this when you forget)

**Add an entry whenever you do something growth-relevant.** That includes:
shipping new content, structural SEO changes (sitemap, schema, redirects,
internal linking), tech changes that affect crawl/indexing, marketing
pushes, backlink campaigns. *Not* every code commit — just things you'd
want to point at when GSC numbers move (or fail to).

**Each entry is a hypothesis you can be wrong about.** Commit to a
measurable KPI and an observation window before acting — otherwise "did
this work?" is just a feeling.

### Lifecycle of one entry

1. **Day of action** — append a new dated H2 with `Status: active`, the
   hypothesis, the KPI you'll watch, current baseline numbers, what you
   did, and the date to review (default: today + 28 days, matching GSC's
   reporting window).
2. **Review day** — pull current GSC numbers, compute delta vs baseline.
   Fill in **Result** and **Learning**. Set **Status** to `shipped` (worked,
   keep going), `failed` (didn't pay off, abandon), or extend the review
   another window if results are ambiguous.
3. **Never rewrite older entries.** Wrong hypotheses are the most valuable
   data — they tell you what NOT to repeat on the next site. Append, don't
   edit.

### Where to get the numbers

```bash
cd ~/work/projects/sites/portfolio && make run ARGS="gsc sync"
```

Then read the row for `montereybayevents.com`. Or pull from
https://search.google.com/search-console directly.

### Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line hypothesis or action>
- **Status:** active | testing | shipped | failed | abandoned
- **Hypothesis:** <what you're betting will work — only on initial / new-bet entries>
- **KPI:** <what GSC metric / query / page>
- **Baseline:** <numbers at start>
- **Action:** <what was done; 1-2 lines>
- **Result:** <numbers after window; "TBD — review YYYY-MM-DD" until then>
- **Learning:** <why it worked / didn't; what to try next; "TBD" until reviewed>
```

## 2026-08-03 — Regional event search is dominated by destination marketing…
- **Status:** active
- **Hypothesis:** Regional event search is dominated by destination marketing organizations optimizing for inspiration, not logistics — and by government calendars published as client-rendered map apps with no indexable HTML. That leaves a wide gap on long-tail, low-competition, high-intent queries: free event lists, exact dates, start times, parking, and road closures. Keyword data confirms it: the head term "monterey car week" is defended at KD 44, but "monterey car week free events," "monterey car week 2026 dates," and "when does monterey car week start" return no difficulty score at all, meaning thin backlink profiles in the top ten. The plan is to win those queries first with genuinely better structured pages, use Car Week as the annual traffic spike that seeds an Instagram audience and newsletter list, and convert that attention into year-round coverage of the 60+ other public events across both counties. Distribution is social-first in year one — Instagram and a Spanish-language WhatsApp channel, since search authority takes months — with the newsletter as the owned asset that survives both algorithm changes and the eleven months a year when nobody is searching for Car Week.
- **KPI:** any GSC traffic — clicks, impressions, indexed-page count
- **Baseline:** 0 clicks / 0 impressions (just deployed)
- **Action:** project scaffolded via `portfolio new bootstrap`; first deploy pending. After deploy: verify in GSC as `sc-domain:montereybayevents.com` and submit the sitemap.
- **Result:** TBD — review 2026-08-31
- **Learning:** TBD
